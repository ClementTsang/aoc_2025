# Day 7

Fun note, did this one on a train to Stockholm while on a trip.

Jeez this was a confusing one to read. The solution to both is thankfully
just using a DFS; the second part requires some memoziation. I did struggle
a bit here for part 2 because I overcomplicated the cache "key" and passing in
the full path - it was working for the test input but failing for the real thing
and running forever. The real trick was just caching by position.
