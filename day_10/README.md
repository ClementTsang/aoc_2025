# Day 10

"Brute forced" part 1 with a bit of pruning logic (if you go over the number of states with presses, you're probably doing it wrong).

Part 2 is solved by just treating it as a system of linear equations and throwing
z3 at it. Not a great way to do it but it is what it is.

Also:

> You have to push each button an integer number of times; there's no such thing as "0.5 presses" (But only because these aren't A buttons)

Of course he also knows this reference lol.
